## Overview
The overall goal for our project is to create an interface which allows for students and classmates to be able to create effective collaborative interactions where students can obtain help on current ICS materials or help others. Another goal is to create an environment that is inviting and effective for students who would instead be struggling on their own, so they can receive assistance from other like minded students who are able to help. 

## Deployment

A live deployment of Study-ext is available at [https://study-ext.xyz](https://study-ext.xyz).

## User Guide

## Milestone-1
Link to our Milestone 1 page found [here](https://github.com/Study-ext/study-ext/projects/1). 

Our overall goals for milestone 1 was to create a rough outline of what we want our project to look like. We created mock up designs of each page within our site, including the landing, home, calendar, leaderboard, create a session, and profile page. Our main issue was designing a point system which we will use to rank our users. We have defined a point system, but it is subject to change later if we face problems. 

## Milestone-2
Link to our Milestone 2 page found [here](https://github.com/Study-ext/study-ext/projects/3?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen).
