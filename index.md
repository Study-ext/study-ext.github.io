## Overview
The overall goal for our project is to create an interface which allows for students and classmates to be able to create effective collaborative interactions where students can obtain help on current ICS materials or help others. Another goal is to create an environment that is inviting and effective for students who would instead be struggling on their own, so they can receive assistance from other like minded students who are able to help.
